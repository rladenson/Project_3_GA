# devPort

devPort - Developer Port 

A full CRUD app designed to provide community and a showplace for software developers



Combining the reach of social media and the power of online networking, we have designed an app that creates a place for software engineers to display their portfolios. Each profile contains a representational image for the portfolio projects, links to the live project, as well as a link to the developer’s GitHub.
